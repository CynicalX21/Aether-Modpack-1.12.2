# Aether-Modpack-1.12.2
Curseforge sucks so I used github instead.

So basically, drop the mods into your mods folder in .minecraft.

For servers, do the same but exclude Optifine and Xaero's Minimap. If you try to run server.jar with these, 
it will crash on startup.

unzip "Config" in .minecraft. For servers, extract the folder to the root server folder.
