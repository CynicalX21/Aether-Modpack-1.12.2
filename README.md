# Aether-Modpack-1.12.2

//WARNING! GITHUB WON'T LET ME ADD A MOD DUE TO FILE SIZE. MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD "Fossils and Archeology: Revival" version 8.0.6 FROM https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fossils/files

Curseforge sucks so I used github instead.

So after downloading everything, drop the mods(basically all of the .jar files) into your mods folder in .minecraft.

For servers, do the same but exclude Optifine and Xaero's Minimap. If you try to run server.jar with these, 
it will crash on startup.

unzip "Config" in .minecraft. For servers, extract the folder to the root server folder.

Extract the "Addons" folder into .minecraft. Without this, the custom Lucky Blocks will not work.
